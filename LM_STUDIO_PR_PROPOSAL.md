# Changelog Entry

### Description

This pull request introduces comprehensive LM Studio integration to Open WebUI, enabling users to configure, manage, and interact with local LM Studio models directly through the web interface. The implementation includes both configuration settings and unified model management alongside existing Ollama models.

### Added

- **LM Studio Settings Page**: Complete configuration interface in Admin Settings with comprehensive options:
  - Connection settings (URL, API key, timeouts)
  - Model parameters (max tokens, temperature, top-p, top-k, repeat penalty)
  - Advanced options (CORS, logging, auto-refresh, streaming)
- **LM Studio Model Management**: Integrated model operations within the existing Models settings page:
  - Provider filter dropdown (All Providers/Ollama/LM Studio)
  - Load/unload functionality for LM Studio models
  - Provider badges and status indicators
  - Unified interface for both Ollama and LM Studio models
- **Backend API Endpoints**: Full LM Studio router implementation (`/api/v1/lmstudio/`):
  - `GET /models` - List available LM Studio models
  - `POST /models/load` - Load a specific model
  - `POST /models/unload` - Unload a specific model
  - `GET /models/{model_id}` - Get detailed model information
- **Configuration Management**: LM Studio-specific configuration endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/configs/lm_studio` - Retrieve LM Studio settings
  - `POST /api/v1/configs/lm_studio` - Update LM Studio configuration
- **Frontend API Integration**: TypeScript API client functions for LM Studio operations
- **Enhanced Models UI**: Provider-specific displays and operations with visual differentiation

### Changed

- **Models Settings Page**: Enhanced to support multiple model providers with filtering capabilities
- **Model Display Logic**: Updated to handle different provider types (Ollama vs LM Studio)
- **API Structure**: Extended configuration API to support provider-specific settings
- **Frontend State Management**: Modified to handle combined model collections from multiple sources

### Dependencies

- **Added**: `y-protocols` - Required for editor compatibility and collaborative features
- **Updated**: `package-lock.json` - Resolved dependency conflicts and added new dependencies

### Fixed

- **CORS Configuration**: Fixed development CORS issues for proper frontend-backend communication
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Resolved TipTap extension version conflicts using legacy peer deps
- **Module Loading**: Fixed JavaScript module loading issues in development environment

### Security

- **Input Validation**: All LM Studio API endpoints include proper request validation
- **Authentication**: LM Studio endpoints require proper admin/user authentication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information leakage

---

### Additional Information

This implementation provides a seamless integration between Open WebUI and LM Studio, allowing users to:

1. **Configure LM Studio connections** through the admin interface
2. **Manage both Ollama and LM Studio models** in a unified interface  
3. **Load/unload LM Studio models** on demand
4. **Filter models by provider** for easier management
5. **Maintain existing Ollama functionality** without disruption

The integration follows Open WebUI's existing patterns and conventions:
- Consistent with existing router implementations
- Follows established frontend component structure
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing features
- Uses proper TypeScript typing throughout

**Technical Notes:**
- LM Studio integration requires LM Studio to be running locally (default: `http://localhost:1234`)
- Configuration is stored using the existing config system
- Model operations are provider-aware to prevent conflicts
- Error handling gracefully degrades when LM Studio is unavailable

**Related Issues:**
- Addresses user requests for LM Studio support in the community
- Provides alternative to cloud-based model providers
- Enhances local model management capabilities
